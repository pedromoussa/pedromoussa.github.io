                    Horseshoe crabs are marine and brackish water arthropods of the family Limulidae and the only living members of the order Xiphosura. Despite their name, they are not true crabs or crustaceans; they are chelicerates, most closely related to arachnids, such as spiders and scorpions.
                    <br>Horseshoe crabs live primarily in and around shallow coastal waters on soft, sandy or muddy bottoms. They are generally found in the intertidal zone at spring high tides. They are eaten in some parts of Asia, and used as fishing bait, in fertilizer and in science (especially Limulus amebocyte lysate).
                    In recent years, population declines have occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction and overharvesting. Tetrodotoxin may be present in one horseshoe crab species, Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda.

                <h3>Some of their characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>They like to dine at night on worms and clams, and may also eat algae</li>
                    <li>The horseshoe crab picks up food with appendages located in front of its mouth</li>
                    <li>Because it has no mandible or teeth, they crush the food between their legs before passing it to the mouth</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Top 3 facts about the Horseshoe Crab</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Horseshoe crabs have been around for more than 300 million years, making them even older than dinosaurs.</li>
                    <li>The horseshoe crab's tail is called the telson. It's long and pointed, and although it looks intimidating, it is not dangerous, poisonous, or used to sting. Horseshoe crabs use the telson to flip themselves over if they happen to be pushed on their backs</li>
                    <li>During full moons, new moons, and high tides in May and June, hundreds of thousands of horseshoe crabs converge on the Delaware Bay to breed</li>
